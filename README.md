# Technical Analysis Library for Crypto Bot (Python)
Developed a lightweight Python library that implements core technical indicators for use in algorithmic crypto trading systems.

- Indicators: RSI, EMA, MACD, Bollinger Bands, and more
- Pure Python implementation with no external TA libraries
- Suitable for signal generation, backtesting, and real-time bot integration

Used in conjunction with my previously built trading bot and designed to be modular and performant.
